##acetyl-COA synthase 

###intermediate between anabolic and catabolic pathways and creates molecules needed for the TCA cycle in energy production

##magnesium transporter

###used to transport proteins across the cell membrane in order to offset chemical balances

##dUMP phostase

###causes changes to the pH through the crystalization of various cell membrane organelles

##lysine tRNA synthesase

###catalyzes lys-tRNA when lysine is ready to be inserted in proteins

##D-xylose phosphatase

###used to bind ATP through xylose onto various energy creating mechanisms
